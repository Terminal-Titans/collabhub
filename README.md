# CollabHub  : Connecting Minds , Building Together

# Problem Statement 
In the daily routine of developers, they often encounter difficulties in finding project partners who share their interests and goals. The lack of an efficient platform to connect developers with
similar interests hinders their ability to collaborate and contribute to meaningful projects. As a result, developers struggle to find the right people to work with and end up wasting time and
resources trying to identify potential partners. This problem not only limits the growth of individual developers but also slows down the progress of the overall software development
community. Addressing this issue by providing a comprehensive solution for finding project partners with similar interests can significantly reduce the challenges faced by developers and
enable them to work more efficiently and effectively via sharing their knowledge with each other.

# Solutions
Our solution is a web-based platform called "CollabHub," which connects people with similar interests and skills to collaborate on a particular project, share knowledge and learn from each
other. The platform will have a user-friendly interface that allows users to create a profile, search for projects based on their interests, and connect with other users. Users can start their own
projects and invite other users to collaborate
